# Number Guessing Game
This is a simple guessing game for out assembly class contest. We wrote it using Assembly (MASM) and irvine32.
The program chooses a number between 1-100 and prompts the user to keep guessing until the user gets the number correct. When guessing, the program will tell the user if the number is too high or too low. The program will also display the number of attempts the user took.

# How to run
1. Assemble the file in MASM
2. Include Irvine32.inc
3. Link with Irvine32.lib
4. Run the program

   # What I learned
   Using loops and jumps (JE,JG,JL).
   Reading numbers with ReadInt
   Showing messages with WriteString
   Counting tries with a variable.

   # Notes
   We followed the class rules
   Everything compiles and runs without errors
   We used RandomRange from Irvine32
